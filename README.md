# Restaurant Reviews Project
This is a Udacity project that contains different restaurants in different neighbourhoods and views their info, location and reviews.

## _Installing_
Do the following steps:
1. Download the zipped folder (Or you can clone the repo and skip step 2)
2. Unzip it
3. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
4. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and that's it.

## _Built With_
- HTML => Structure of the main and reviews pages, Providing web accessibility techniques
- CSS => Designing the colors and layout of the site in different viewports
- JavaScript => Functionality and interactivity of the site, Adding service workers and caching the site for offline experience
